Here is my standardized answer based on the document:

- The mentor’s role is to support students in completing tasks related to the thesis.
- Students must email their thesis submission deadline in the specified format by the deadline (e.g., thesis submission deadline = 2025 Apr).
- Communication will occur via MS Teams and email, with all submissions containing the student’s full name and NEPTUN code.

After reading through the mentor’s welcome message, it’s clear how important it is to stay proactive and engaged. I appreciate the structured guidance for the thesis, especially knowing that our work must be reproducible and data-focused. I think this approach really prepares us for real-world applications in computer science.

As for the communication expectations, I’ll admit that using multiple platforms (Teams, Moodle, email) can be a lot to manage, but it does make sense to keep everyone updated efficiently. I'll make it a point to stay active and check in daily.

Looking forward to this journey together!

In this document, a standardized answer refers to responses that follow a specific, pre-determined format for consistency across sections. These answers are structured to align with set guidelines or templates and follow a systematic approach in presenting information, which includes:

Uniform Structure: Every parameter discussed in the ""Automation of Parameters"" chapter is presented with the same fields: Data Source, Automation Tool, Automation Method, and Optimization Ideas. This approach standardizes the document and simplifies analysis.

Clear Terminology: Using the same technical terms and structure for each automated parameter enhances readability, reduces ambiguity, and makes the content easy to compare across different sections. For instance, all references to ""Automation Tool"" or ""Data Source"" would be uniform, rather than using varying terms for similar concepts.

Concise Detail and Relevant Information Only: Each answer includes only information directly relevant to automation, minimizing extraneous details. Screenshots, code snippets, and explanations are given in a manner that supports clarity, rather than overwhelming the reader with unrelated content.

Such a standardized format would make it straightforward for readers to locate specific details about each automated parameter without sifting through inconsistent information or structure.

Non-Standardized Answer Possibilities
In contrast, a non-standardized answer would vary in format, style, and level of detail, potentially resulting in responses that:

Lack a Uniform Structure: Responses might differ from section to section in how they present data sources, tools, and methods. For instance, one automated parameter might start with a general description, while another immediately dives into specific details, leading to inconsistency across sections.

Use Inconsistent Terminology: Different technical terms might be used interchangeably (e.g., using “monitoring software” in one section and “automation tool” in another). This inconsistency can make it harder for readers to follow and compare the information.

Include Varying Levels of Detail: Some sections might have extensive narrative explanations, while others are brief or omit specific technical steps altogether.

Rephrasing the Subject Line: Saying something like “I will submit my thesis in April 2025” instead of using the exact wording doesn’t follow the template, which makes it harder to track.
Listing Multiple Options: Including more than one possible date or other variations creates inconsistencies.

Its specified length is 96 characters.

Generally, a formal, well-organized email message I write typically falls between 100-150 words, depending on the level of detail and precision required.
The example message I provided is approximately 80-100 words (96), which I believe is ideal for a simple yet informative response.

Why is that?

The length of my response depends on how detailed I choose to make the message. If I keep it concise and to the point, it will be shorter, while adding more details naturally increases the length.

""What is this number being relevant for further planning activities?""

Explanation: Standardizing responses:

Saves Time: Having a set of pre-drafted responses reduces the time you spend composing similar messages.
Improves Consistency: Standardization ensures clarity and professionalism in all interactions, which can help maintain a clear communication style with your mentor.
Enhances Organization: You can focus on planning and tracking progress rather than drafting each message individually.

„What is the derivation rule for this number?”

Example Derivation Rule:

Identify Key Topics: Look for common communication themes in your mentor interactions, such as thesis updates, meeting requests, and feedback queries.
Frequency of Use: Prioritize responses based on how often each topic arises.
Adjust for Specific Requirements: Include any specialized responses your mentor or the documentation emphasizes.",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,299,1668

The primary focus is on data sourcing, automation tools, and optimization:

Data Source Relevance and Reliability:

For each automated parameter, it's essential to confirm that the data source (such as IDS logs or antivirus logs) is reliable and captures relevant information consistently. Without dependable data, automation could produce inaccurate or inconsistent results, which would undermine the automation process's purpose.
Tool Selection and Compatibility:

Selecting appropriate tools (e.g., vnStat, SNMP, antivirus APIs) that integrate smoothly with the system environment is crucial. Compatibility with the existing network setup and the ability to automate parameter collection without excessive manual intervention is a fundamental part of the system plan.
Automation Methods and Optimization:

The choice of automation methods (API calls, scheduled scripts) directly impacts efficiency. Optimizing these methods by reducing redundant checks and focusing on critical parameters can enhance performance, reduce computational load, and improve response times.
Error Handling and System Monitoring:

A well-designed logical system plan must include robust error handling and regular monitoring. For instance, if an API fails or a network issue disrupts data collection, the system should have mechanisms to retry or log errors, minimizing disruption and maintaining system reliability.
This logical system plan ensures that automated processes are accurate, efficient, and responsive to potential disruptions. Adopting these measures will help maintain data integrity and consistency across all automated parameters.",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,234,1491

Hardware Requirements and Capacity:

Since data collection and monitoring will run continuously, the physical system needs sufficient processing power and memory. If the system includes multiple tools like vnStat, SNMP, and antivirus APIs, we should ensure that it can handle simultaneous queries without significant lag or resource contention.
Network Infrastructure:

The physical system plan should account for a stable network connection to support real-time data transfer, especially if APIs or SNMP requests are made to external or remote devices. Network bandwidth must also be managed to prevent interference with other operational activities.
Storage Capacity and Data Retention:

Storing logs, historical data, and snapshots of automated parameters requires adequate storage. This is especially important for long-term analyses or audits. The storage system should be scalable and capable of retaining data for the duration specified by the project’s requirements.
Redundancy and Backup Systems:

Redundancy in hardware (e.g., dual network interfaces, backup servers) can help ensure continuity in case of hardware failures. A backup system for critical data is also necessary to protect against data loss.
Physical Security:

As automation often involves sensitive data (e.g., threat logs from IDS or antivirus software), it is essential to consider physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the hardware and stored data.
This physical system plan ensures that the automation experiments have a stable, secure, and scalable foundation to operate efficiently and handle the demands of continuous data monitoring and processing.",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,255,1532

Scalability:

As data volumes and monitoring requirements grow, the system must be scalable. This could involve designing a modular architecture that allows for adding new data sources, APIs, or monitoring tools without disrupting existing operations.
Maintenance and Updates:

Automated systems often rely on APIs and software that may need regular updates for security and compatibility. A structured update schedule and maintenance plan will help keep the system functioning optimally and secure from vulnerabilities.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Future operation will benefit from robust error handling. For example, if an API call fails or a data source becomes unavailable, the system should log the error and attempt to retry or switch to a backup. Implementing a monitoring dashboard can also help operators track system health and performance in real time.
Adaptability for Future Technologies:

Automation tools and methods are rapidly evolving, with emerging technologies like AI and machine learning becoming increasingly relevant. The system should be designed to accommodate future enhancements, enabling integration with newer tools and technologies as they become available.
Cost and Resource Efficiency:

To ensure sustainable operation, the system should balance performance with cost efficiency. This might involve optimizing data storage, minimizing redundant operations, and managing resource usage to reduce operating costs over time.
User and Security Management:

Over time, there may be changes in user roles or security policies. The system should include flexible user management options, such as role-based access control, to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data or functions.

After reviewing the system plan documentation, I would like to offer several suggestions for refinement and clarification:

Concrete Examples and Specifications

The document frequently uses qualitative terms like ""suspicious,"" ""unusual,"" or ""significant"" without defining specific thresholds or metrics
Recommendation: Define precise numerical thresholds for each monitored parameter, for example:

CPU usage > 90% for > 30 seconds
Memory usage spike of > 50% within 5 seconds
Disk write rate > 80MB/s sustained for > 1 minute

Real-time Processing Architecture

The current plan mentions real-time monitoring but doesn't specify the technical implementation
Suggested additions:

Define polling interval (e.g., 2-second intervals as mentioned in analysis)
Specify buffer size for temporary data storage
Detail how the system handles concurrent monitoring of multiple parameters
Outline data processing pipeline from collection to analysis

Decision Making Logic

The COCO Y0 algorithm implementation needs more detailed specification:

Input parameters and their weights
Decision thresholds for triggering alerts
False positive mitigation strategy
Example decision tree with concrete scenarios

System Boundaries and Integration

Clarify exactly what the system will and won't handle:

Which security responses are automated vs. requiring user intervention
Integration points with Windows Performance Monitor API
Data persistence and historical analysis capabilities
Limitations of the monitoring scope

Performance Impact

Address the system's own resource consumption:

Expected CPU/memory footprint
Impact on system performance
Optimization strategies for minimal overhead

Benchmark Comparisons

As suggested in the comments, include:

Comparison with existing monitoring solutions
Expected performance improvements
Unique features justifying new development
Quantitative benefits over current solutions

Flow Chart Enhancement

The flow chart should be expanded to include:

Standard flow chart symbols and conventions
Decision points with specific conditions
Error handling paths
System state transitions
Integration points with external systems

AI Implementation Details

For the AI-based prioritization system:

Specify training data requirements
Define feature selection criteria
Detail model update frequency
Compare with non-AI alternatives
Justify AI usage with concrete benefits

	*
Context Models illustrate a system's operational environment, defining boundaries and external interactions. They assist in understanding the system’s role within a larger framework.

	*
Interaction Models use diagrams (e.g., use case and sequence diagrams) to show interactions between the system and users or other systems. This helps in identifying and clarifying user requirements and potential communication issues.

	*
Structural Models focus on the architecture and data structures within the system. Class diagrams are used extensively to show relationships and dependencies between objects.

	*
Behavioral Models describe how systems respond dynamically to events and data inputs. They are represented by activity diagrams (data processing) and state diagrams (event responses).

	*
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) aims to develop software by creating high-level models that can be transformed into code, reducing dependency on programming languages. MDE includes various types of models, like Computation Independent Models (CIM), Platform Independent Models (PIM), and Platform Specific Models (PSM). The document discusses Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) and Executable UML (xUML) as ways to implement MDE principles.

- Dynamic Context Awareness: Context modeling can be enhanced by incorporating real-time data from various sources, such as network traffic, user behavior, and system logs. This allows the model to adapt dynamically to changes in the operational environment and detect anomalies indicative of cyber threats.

- Threat Intelligence Integration: Integrating threat intelligence feeds into context models helps identify known threats and vulnerabilities relevant to the system's environment. This contextual information can assist in predicting potential attack vectors and adapting system defenses accordingly.

- Behavioral Analysis: By modeling typical user and system behaviors, deviations from the norm can be flagged as potential security threats. Machine learning techniques can analyze historical data to refine behavior profiles and improve detection accuracy.

- Risk Assessment Models: Context modeling can include risk assessment components that evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of various threats. By quantifying risks, organizations can prioritize security measures based on the context of specific operational environments.

Integration of Security Measures in MDE:

- Security Requirements at the Requirements Level: MDE allows for the early specification of security requirements within models. Security aspects can be captured alongside functional requirements, ensuring that security considerations are integrated from the beginning of the development process.

- Architecture-Level Security: At the architectural level, security patterns can be modeled to ensure that security controls are part of the system's design. This includes defining secure communication channels, access controls, and other architectural safeguards.

- Design-Level Security: MDE can facilitate the incorporation of security measures at the design level, such as specifying secure interaction protocols and data handling processes. Models can be enriched with security-related elements that guide implementation.

- Code Generation with Security in Mind: MDE supports the generation of code from models, and security constraints can be embedded into the code generation process. Security annotations in models can drive the generation of secure code.

Challenges in Automating Secure Code Generation:

- Complexity of Security Policies: Security requirements can be complex and context-dependent, making it challenging to automate their implementation accurately. Capturing all necessary security controls in models can be difficult.

- Diversity of Security Standards: Different systems may need to adhere to various security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Automating code generation to comply with multiple standards requires a flexible and adaptable model.

- Integration of Security Testing: Automating security testing within the MDE pipeline is essential to ensure that generated code adheres to security requirements. However, developing effective automated security testing tools that can work seamlessly with MDE is a significant challenge.

- Evolving Threat Landscape: The constantly changing nature of cybersecurity threats requires that security measures in MDE be regularly updated. Automating this process while ensuring compliance with the latest security practices poses ongoing challenges.

- Skill Gaps and Expertise: The successful implementation of MDE with security measures requires expertise in both modeling and cybersecurity. The lack of skilled professionals in these areas can hinder the effective integration of security into the development process.

Adapting context modeling to address cybersecurity threats involves integrating security-focused elements to identify potential vulnerabilities and access points in the system's operational environment. One approach is to extend context models with additional layers that detail trusted and untrusted boundaries, identify potential attack vectors, and specify security roles for each external interaction. This adaptation can be achieved by:

Defining Threat Boundaries: Clearly mark boundaries where external interactions pose security risks, such as between user access points and critical system resources.
Adding Threat Agents and Trust Levels: Include representations of potential threat agents and assign trust levels to various users or external systems to gauge where higher scrutiny is needed.
Mapping Data Sensitivity: Highlight areas of the system that handle sensitive or confidential data, as these are potential targets for cyber attacks.
Integrating Security Controls: Show security controls or mitigations, such as firewalls, access controls, and encryption, as part of the model to demonstrate how the system defends against external threats.
This approach ensures that stakeholders can visualize where security risks exist and how the system is structured to mitigate them, providing a clear picture of the cybersecurity landscape within the operational environment.

2.What are the best practices for incorporating secure interaction modeling within systems that handle sensitive or critical data?

Secure interaction modeling in systems dealing with sensitive data requires a focus on protecting data flows, authentication, and authorization processes. Best practices include:

Use of Secure Communication Protocols: Ensure that all interaction models, such as sequence diagrams, incorporate secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, TLS) to protect data transmission.
User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define user roles clearly in use case diagrams and specify secure access control mechanisms, ensuring that only authorized roles have access to critical data.
Input Validation and Sanitization: Model interactions that involve data input with checks for input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks and other malicious inputs.
Auditing and Logging Points: Indicate key points within interaction models for logging and monitoring user activities, which can help in detecting suspicious behavior or breaches.
Data Masking and Encryption: Represent how sensitive data is encrypted or masked during interactions to reduce exposure risks, especially in systems where data is exchanged between trusted and untrusted boundaries.
Incorporating these elements ensures that interaction models not only define functionality but also reinforce security measures critical to protecting sensitive information.

3.How does model-driven engineering (MDE) integrate security measures at different model levels, and what are the challenges in automating secure code generation?

In Model-Driven Engineering, integrating security at different model levels involves embedding security requirements across each model abstraction, from high-level conceptual models to platform-specific implementations:

Computation Independent Models (CIM): CIMs can capture high-level security goals and compliance requirements without tying them to specific technologies. These models specify the “what” rather than the “how,” providing a secure foundation.
Platform Independent Models (PIM): PIMs detail the security architecture, including access controls, data protection methods, and encryption. This level allows for the standardization of security measures across various platforms by specifying secure design patterns.
Platform Specific Models (PSM): At the PSM level, models integrate security elements tied to particular platforms, such as specific APIs for encryption, authentication libraries, or data integrity mechanisms. This level ensures that security requirements from higher models are translated into platform-compatible security controls.
Challenges in automating secure code generation include:

Context-Specific Security Needs: Security requirements often depend on the context and may vary widely, making it difficult to automate generalized secure code.
Complexity in Mapping Models to Code: Translating security models to executable code involves complex mappings, especially when ensuring that security protocols are adhered to across multiple platforms and languages.

This response explores the impact of varying name lengths on maintaining a standardized answer format and potential implications for consistency.
Variability in Name Lengths: Unlike dates, which can be uniformly formatted (e.g., ""YYYY-MMM""), names vary significantly in length. Some names are short, like ""Kamilla,"" while others, like ""Zandangarav,"" are much longer. This variation disrupts the ability to maintain a consistent, ideal length, as required by standardization. For example, ""2024-Nov, Kamilla"" is much shorter than ""2024-Nov, Zandangarav,"" meaning that each entry could differ widely in length, which conflicts with the standardized format derived in Task Ia.

Implications for Consistency: Including names alongside dates without controlling for length variations challenges the standardization goal of predictable, fixed-length responses. Standardized answers should ideally be concise and consistent to allow for automated processing and ease of reading. However, varying name lengths reduce predictability and may create confusion for recipients or systems that rely on fixed-length formats.",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,,186,1174

I selected 300 characters as the ideal length because it balances depth and conciseness, allowing enough space to answer questions thoroughly without being excessive. In IT system design, benchmarks and limitations are often set to ensure efficient operation while providing adequate functionality. Similarly, a 300-character limit can offer enough detail to convey complex points clearly while ensuring responses remain straightforward and easy to read.

Option 5. 2026 Nov. (counted as Answer number 5)
Option 6. Other/Later. (counted as Answer number 6).

IF number of LENGTHS are considered, my answer could be 37.

WHY: From my point of view, there are 37 characters in the ideal/standardized answer (ONLY IF the Subject field of email is considered). According to the ""demo0"", it mentioned that the subject field is has to prepared (Thesis Submission Deadline = <...See options below...> and the FULL ideal/standardized answer is prepared like ""Thesis Submission Deadline = 2025 Apr"" (37 characters and includes space and equal sign).

IF the body content of email is considered an answer, the ideal/standardized answer length could be changed. In demo0, it mentioned that ""you MUST contain clear data with full names and NEPTUN codes"". There are many types of limits on names. For example, in Passport Systems of some countries limit names to around 39 characters. On the other hand, in Social Media Platforms limit names to around 50 characters. Besides, in Databases, many databases and forms might limit names to 255 characters which is a common maximum length for text fields, and it could be more confusing and complicated.

Identify Date Format (YYYY MMM)by using a regex pattern like ...\b(202[4-7])\s(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)\b to locate the date within the input, and handle possible different formats like in this example (See: https://moodle.kodolanyi.hu/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=62886#p163272) then reformat into the standardized answer.

There are a few problems to address when making sure the answers are correct:

Problem A: Same Length

All answers need to be 8 characters long. Dates like ""2024-Nov"" and ""2026-Nov"" fit this length. We should use the ""YYYY-MMM"" format to keep all answers the same length.

Problem B: Valid Dates

We need to make sure the dates are valid based on the demo0-annex. For example, if the demo0-annex starts from ""2024-Nov,"" we should not accept earlier dates like ""2024-JAN"" as valid.

Solution and Self-Check
To solve these problems:

Use a Standard Format: All dates should be in the ""YYYY-MMM"" format. This keeps the length the same for all answers.
Check Valid Dates: Only include dates from ""2024-Nov"" onwards. This ensures all dates are valid according to the demo0-annex.

High Negative Values (e.g. -5 in rows AF4 and AF20):

Example: In rows AF4 (Ankhbold Amin-Erdene) and AF20 (Nyambaatar Zandangarav), both have a ""problem?"" value of -5. This indicates they have high standards in scoring others, giving scores (0) that are lower than the average ratings they receive (5). Despite this, the class overall has a positive evaluation of these people.

Positive differences, such as the +5 in row AF10 (Dangiwa Japheth Jerry), show a person who tends to rate others at an average of 6 but overall, other peers tend to grade this individual at a much lower grade, at an average of 1.

	*
CONTRADICTORY SCORES:

	* For instance, if ""Muhammad Khuram Latif"" gave a score of 8 to someone who didn’t really participate or contribute, it makes you wonder how fair that score really is. It feels like there might be some bias or favoritism going on instead of a genuine evaluation of that person's work.
	* The same goes for ""Cabral de Noronha e Menezes Furtado António Maria."" If they got a high score from someone who also didn’t participate, it creates a contradiction. It makes it hard to trust those scores since they don’t reflect actual contributions.

	*
WHY THIS HAPPENS:

	* LACK OF PARTICIPATION: When students don’t engage with the tasks, they can’t give valid evaluations. So, if they score others, it often leads to inflated scores based on personal relationships rather than real performance. This really messes with the integrity of the whole evaluation process.
	* RANDOM SCORING: If someone is giving scores to classmates who didn’t contribute, it shows they’re not taking the evaluation seriously. This can create tension among those who actually put in the effort, making it feel unfair that some are getting high scores without doing the work.

The reasoning behind this consistent score is that, while there were slight differences in their responses, the underlying logic was generally the same. Most students demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept of a standardized answer, considering the requirements and format constraints provided.
One notable response stated that the standardized length is 8, highlighting that the answer's format follows a 'YYYY MMM' structure, totaling 8 characters, including spaces. This approach showed precise reasoning based on the length of the response format.
Another student approached the task differently, suggesting that the ideal answer length should be 37 characters. They broke down the calculation by explaining that the base part of the answer, ""thesis submission deadline =,"" accounts for 29 characters (with spaces), and the option, such as ""2024 Nov,"" adds 8 characters. This response demonstrated attention to detail and careful calculation.
A third student focused on the importance of accuracy and clarity, emphasizing that concise, precise wording aids comprehension without unnecessary details. They noted that maintaining brevity while ensuring completeness could reduce the character count without compromising the answer’s clarity.
Lastly, one student chose a longer response format (96 characters) to include additional context. They provided a more comprehensive answer by writing a short, yet informative, email that incorporated expressions of gratitude, the response itself, and an assurance of thorough work on the thesis. This approach, while different, highlighted their interpretation of the requirements and showed how various formats could still align with the main logic of a standardized answer.
The slight variations in these answers stem from different interpretations of what constitutes a ""standardized answer"" based on format and requirements.

Together, these components total 37 characters, including spaces. 

The count of potential answers with this ideal length was determined to be 5, as the instructions explicitly offered five thesis submission deadlines for students to choose from. 

The selection of the winner was complicated due to the timing and accuracy of the responses. Byekbolat Nurbol was the only participant to submit a fully correct answer; however, his submission was received late, at 01:28 on November 4. By that time, the correct answers had already been established. Earlier submissions by other participants demonstrated partial accuracy. For instance, Turtogtokh Shagai correctly identified the ideal answer length of 37 at 19:06, while Nyambaatar Zandangarav identified the number of potential answers as five at 15:15. However, neither Tuttogtokh Shagai nor Nyambaatar Zandangarav successfully addressed both components of the question.

Consistency: Measure the range of scores given to and received by the student. For example, Munkhjargal Ariunbold consistently scores between 7 and 9 across all evaluations, achieving 90% consistency.

High-Quality: Based on the log-data, we calculate the percentage of correct answers out of total answers. For example, if 9 out of 10 answers are correct, the high-quality score is 90%.

Clarity: Munkhjargal’s answer was 6, also he informed why does he choose it. So the clarity is good. So high quality score is exactly 85% or more above.

Precision: Precision is calculated by comparing the number of relevant points in an answer to the total points made. For instance, if Munkhjargal includes 18 relevant points out of 20, the precision score is 90%.

Major-Level Issues: Using binary logic, we count errors or contradictions in answers. Munkhjargal has 0 major issues across all responses, meeting the ""error-free"" criterion.

Based on these metrics, Munkhjargal Ariunbold demonstrates:

Consistency: 90%
High-Quality: 90%
Clarity: 80%
Precision: 90%
Major-Level Issues: 100% error-free
